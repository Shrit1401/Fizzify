            <p>I guess you're here to buy a cold drink.</p>

            <p>but from today onwards we're stopping delivering cold drinks</p>

            <p>
              I think we made too much of our name ourselves in the campus. We
              could've sold more bottles if we didn't make it this big
            </p>

            <p>
              Itâ€™s still crazy to me that so many people know me just because of
              cold drinks.
            </p>

            <p>
              we knew we will not be selling cold drink for this long. but we
              never thought that it can be this big
            </p>

            <p>
              thanks a lot, for trusting this dumb guy who came to banglore
              litreally a month ago, you're gonna see him more in future trying
              dumb shit
            </p>

            <p>
              but shrit is not going anywhere. i'm going to continue to make
              something crazy for you. muha
